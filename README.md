# Windows Command Line Utilities
A collection of simple command-line utilities created by me.

## Usage
You can download this repo either by using the 'Clone or download' dropdown menu or clicking (this link.)[https://github.com/CutieGorlAstrid/windows-cmd-utils/archive/master.zip]
Simply extract to any directory and run the programs from `CMD.EXE`. Preferably, you'll want to add these to PATH.

You can either...
### ...extract them to your Windows directory
Simply drag and drop the utilities in `C:\Windows` or any of its subfolders.

### ...extract them anywhere on your hard drive and add them to PATH
This is a bit more involved than the last method. You can extract the programs anywhere, but you have to manually add the folder that the programs are in to the PATH environment variables.
